; How often (in seconds) to check file timestamps for changes to the shared
; memory storage allocation. ("1" means validate once per second, but only

; In production, set to a higher value to reduce file system checks

; When disabled, you must reset the OPcache manually or restart the
; webserver for changes to the filesystem to take effect.
; In production, set to 0 to prevent OPcache from checking file timestamps
; This improves performance but requires manual cache clearing when files are updated

; The maximum number of keys (scripts) in the OPcache hash table.
; Only numbers between 200 and 1000000 are allowed.
; Increased to accommodate more scripts

; Increased for better performance
